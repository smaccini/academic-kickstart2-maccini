My research interests focus on the power of digital engagement to spur advocacy on behalf of destinations, with an emphasis on the destination's historical and cultural attributes.  In addition to pursuing my PhD in Texts and Technology, I teach the Data Driven Decision Making course with UCF's Integrated Business program.
